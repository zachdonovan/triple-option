 * TRIPLE OPTION
 *
 * an homage to Ten-Yard Fight.
 * by Zachary Donovan
 *
 * Triple Option is a radically restricted
 * American football simulation. In the game,
 * the player carries out a series of
 * simple plays seeking to evade the defense, 
 * gain as many yards as possible, score a  
 * touchdown, etc.
 *
 * Play consists of groups of four downs in which
 * player completes a series of plays with brief
 * pauses before the start of the next play.
 * The player is limited to the three plays for
 * which the game is named: handoff to a running
 * back, pass to a wide receiver, or run the
 * ball as the quarterback. There is one special
 * play available as well, which doubles as a
 * punt/field goal attempt, which the player
 * automatically undertakes on fourth down.
 *
 * 1. there are always twenty two players on the
 * field, eleven for each team.
 *
 * 2. There is always exactly 1 football on the
 * field.
